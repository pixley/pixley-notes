# Noun Cases
We don't think about it much in English because we almost entirely rely on word order, but the role a noun plays in a sentence is referred to as its "case".  The one context where English does exhibit case-based changes to words is with pronouns.
## Nominative
This is the subject of a sentence.  In most cases, this is what performs the action described.

> **She** ate a grape.

In the above sentence, some unnamed female is the subject, so the pronoun is put in the nominative case: "she".
## Genitive
This case indicates possession.  The genitive noun owns the thing it modifies.

> **Its** people rose up against the king.

In the above sentence, some unnamed inanimate object (given the context, probably a country) has the people that rose up, so the pronoun is put into the genitive case: "its".
## Accusative
This is the direct object of the sentence.  This is what receives the action described.

> The cat scratched **him**.

In the above sentence, some unnamed male is the direct object, so the pronoun is put in the accusative case: "him".
## Dative
This is the indirect object of the sentence.  This one is more tricky to describe, but it's basically the beneficiary of the action.  English pronouns don't actually make the distinction between accusative and dative forms, but the grammatical role is still important (and German does make the distinction).

> Peter gave **her** the ball.

Note that, while the ball is what is given, it's given *to* someone: an unnamed female.  That pronoun, "her", is put in the dative case.
## Prepositions
For prepositional phrases, nouns also mutate according to the case with which the preposition in question is associated (which case goes with which preposition is unfortunately just something you have to memorize).  In English, all prepositions use the accusative case.

Unfortunately, this means you can't just determine a noun's role in a sentence solely based on its case, since there may be a preposition with it.  However, once you are familiar with the prepositions, it should be a lot easier.

> I got a letter **from her**.

In German, most prepositions use accusative or dative (some even use both to make particular distinctions, such as direction vs position), but a few use genitive.
## Table of English Pronoun Cases
| **Noun Case** | **1st Singular** | **1st Plural** | **2nd Person** | **3rd Masculine Singular** | **3rd Feminine Singular** | **3rd Inanimate Singular** | **3rd Plural / Gender-Neutral Singular** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nominative** | I | we | you | he | she | it | they |
| **Genitive** | my | our | your | his | her | its | their |
| **Accusative** | me | us | you | him | her | it | them |
# Articles
The English language deems it important to differentiate between referring to nouns generically or to a specific instance of that noun.  This is accomplished through the articles "a/an" and "the".

> Bob opened **a** fridge.
> Bob opened **the** fridge.

Consider the difference between the above two sentences.  In the first, Bob is opening an arbitrary fridge, perhaps at an appliance store or something like that.  Regardless, it's not important which fridge is being opened.  In the second, Bob is opening "the fridge", which indicates specificity.  Regarding fridges specifically, it likely refers to the one fridge in the home he's currently in.

The grammatical terms are "indefinite article" for "a/an" and "definite article" for "the".  German makes this same distinction, though in a more complex manner.

One thing to note is that both English and German omit the indefinite article for plural nouns.  Consider the following:

> I saw **a goose** today.
> I saw **geese** today.

However, we still use the definite article for plural nouns.

> **The plumber** went home for the day.
> **The plumbers** went home for the day.
