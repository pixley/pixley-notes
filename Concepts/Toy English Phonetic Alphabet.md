## Goals
- Phonetic spelling for English
	- One letter per sound, but not necessarily one sound per letter
		- Diphthongs are represented with digraphs
	- Reduced vowels are an exception
		- Except for schwa, since it can be permanently reduced, such as in "the" or the "-er" suffix.
	- As few context-dependent pronunciations as possible
		- Written yod-dropping/coalescence was considered, but deemed impractical
- Compatible with all major dialects
	- Received Pronunciation
	- General American
	- Scottish
	- Australian
	- New Zealand
	- Irish
- Use existing letters from similar alphabets; no made-up characters
	- Latin
	- Greek
	- Cyrillic
	- IPA
- Make vowel mutations clear through related letters
	- This is called "trisyllabic laxing"
		- Though laxing also occurs in shorter words, but the same vowel changes are made
	- Like nature -> natural
	- /i:/, fleece -> /ɛ/, dress (serene -> serenity)
	- /eɪ/, face -> /æ/, trap (grateful -> gratitude)
	- /aɪ/, price -> /ɪ/, kit (divine -> divinity)
	- /aʊ/, mouth -> /ʌ/, strut (pronounce -> pronunciation)
	- /oʊ/, goat -> /ɒ/, lot (provoke -> provocative)
## Alphabet
**Note:** Due to significant vowel variation between dialects, vowel sounds are defined using the lexical sets.

## Example: The North Wind and the Sun
### Toy Alphabet

### Real English
The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.

They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other.

Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him;

and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak.

And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
