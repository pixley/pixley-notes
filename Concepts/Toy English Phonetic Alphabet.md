## Goals
- Phonetic spelling for English
	- One letter per sound, but not necessarily one sound per letter
		- Diphthongs are represented with digraphs
	- Reduced vowels are an exception
		- Except for schwa, since it can be permanently reduced, such as in "the" or the "-er" suffix.
	- As few context-dependent pronunciations as possible
		- Written yod-dropping/coalescence was considered, but deemed impractical
- Compatible with all major dialects
	- Received Pronunciation
	- General American
	- Scottish
	- Australian
	- New Zealand
	- Irish
- Use existing letters from similar alphabets; no made-up characters
	- Latin
	- Greek
	- Cyrillic
	- IPA
- Make vowel mutations clear through related letters
	- This is called "trisyllabic laxing"
		- Though laxing also occurs in shorter words, but the same vowel changes are made
	- Like nature -> natural
	- /i:/, fleece -> /ɛ/, dress (serene -> serenity)
	- /eɪ/, face -> /æ/, trap (grateful -> gratitude)
	- /aɪ/, price -> /ɪ/, kit (divine -> divinity)
	- /aʊ/, mouth -> /ʌ/, strut (pronounce -> pronunciation)
	- /oʊ/, goat -> /ɒ/, lot (provoke -> provocative)
## Alphabet
