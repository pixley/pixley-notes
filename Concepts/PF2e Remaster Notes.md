# Mechanical Changes
- The Subtle trait makes a spell automatically benefit from Conceal Spell and Silent Spell
- Spell components have been removed.  Each spell now just has the traits they previously inherited from their components (e.g. a spell that previously had a somatic component now just has the Manipulate trait)
- Schools of magic are gone
	- Certain schools, such as illusion, remain as traits
- Open trait has been removed
- Spell attack/DC proficiency has been unified to no longer be tradition-dependent
- Reposition action has been added to move a creature around you
	- Opposed to Shove, which is purely for moving a creature away from you
- Initial time to Craft has been reduced to 2 days
- All common items can be crafted without the formula
	- Having the formula reduces Craft time to 1 day, though
- Rune transfer clarified to require Magical Crafting
- Item activations now have names
- Alignment has been removed
	- This also removes alignment damage, which has been replaced by spirit damage, which can hurt any creature with a spirit
		- Spirit damage can be augmented via sanctification to holy or unholy
	- Sanctification is the process by which religious classes align themselves with either the celestial or fiendish planes
	- Player characters now select personal edicts and anathema, regardless of religion
- Ability scores have been removed
	- Partial modifier boosts replace odd scores above 18, so you still can't have a +5 before 10th level
- Half-Elf and Half-Orc can now be applied to non-human ancestries
