Existing timeline creation software has one or more of the following limitations:
- Real-world calendar only
- Expensive
- List of events rather than a proper timeline
- Concurrent events don't stack neatly

TimelineBuilder will be a FOSS application that allows for arbitrary calendar system support and displays a proper timeline.

TimelineBuilder is being built with C++20, Qt 6, and pybind11.
