Weebly is no longer fit-for-purpose for Luyou's personal site.  I've used a utility to convert her site to Wordpress and stood up a WP instance on the Ultra Spicy server.
### Action Items
- Restore poetry page, as it did not transfer.
- Check for any other pages or assets that got lost during transfer.
- Check for any pages that got turned into WPClassic pages and convert them to the current standard.
- Give Luyou access and show her around.
