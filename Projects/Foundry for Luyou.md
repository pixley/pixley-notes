In order to get Luyou to want to use Foundry, it needs to be as painless as possible for her to use.  Additionally, we need to be sure that as many of her current pain points with Roll20 are addressed as possible.
### Pain Points with Roll20
- Asset organization is crap, especially for maps
- Forgetting that she's on the GM layer
- Lag
- Vision system unintuitive
- Asshole company behind Roll20
### Automation Luyou Can Use
- Initiative order, including initiative change upon being downed
- Actions remaining
- Quick DC reference?
- MAP
- In-game clock
### Helping Me Help Luyou
- Can link all kind of rules, actions, spells, items, etc in chat, making them easy to share and removes reliance on AoN stability
- Everyone's character sheets (inc inventory) all in one place and readily accessible
### Potential Sticking Points
- Would Luyou prefer printed-out stat blocks?
- Remaster transition
- Having to build proper actors because drag-and-drop images isn't enough
- Images found via file system navigation
### Action Items
- Ensure ability to make PC-like NPCs with little friction
