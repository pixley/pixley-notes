Appointment at the Immigration Office has been completed, and EU Blue Card application has been approved.  In January, our cards will be produced and made available for pickup at the Immigration Office.  Between the time that our original visas expire and obtaining the actual cards, we cannot leave the country.

Employment change is easy after the first year (have to consult authorities before the one-year mark).  Permanent residency is possible after 33 months and proof of A1 German language proficiency (21 months if B1 reached).

Unless permanent residency is obtained, EU Blue Card is only valid for up to 4 years (if employment contract is finite, then length of contract plus three months).  This can be extended under certain conditions.

The German EU Blue Card does not grant the right to work in other EU member states.  One would need to apply for that country's Blue Card.
