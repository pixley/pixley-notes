Residency permit documentation has been submitted to Selmir at Fragomen.  Next and final step should be receiving the actual permits/cards, any corrections to registration forms notwithstanding.

Employment change is easy after the first year (have to consult authorities before the one-year mark).  Permanent residency is possible after 33 months and proof of A1 German language proficiency (21 months if B1 reached).

Unless permanent residency is obtained, EU Blue Card is only valid for up to 4 years (if employment contract is finite, then length of contract plus three months).  This can be extended under certain conditions.

The German EU Blue Card does not grant the right to work in other EU member states.  One would need to apply for that country's Blue Card.
