Residency cards have been obtained!  **Task complete!**

Employment change is easy after the first year (have to consult authorities before the one-year mark).  [[Permanent Residency]] is possible after 33 months and proof of A1 German language proficiency (21 months if B1 reached).

Unless permanent residency is obtained, EU Blue Card is only valid for up to 4 years (if employment contract is finite, then length of contract plus three months).  This can be extended under certain conditions.  Tyler cannot be self-employed.

The German EU Blue Card does not grant the right to work in other EU member states.  One would need to apply for that country's Blue Card.
