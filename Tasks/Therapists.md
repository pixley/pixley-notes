Psychotherapy is not often covered by public insurance.  I will need to check to see if the work-provided Allianz coverage includes it, and whether those benefits apply to Luyou as well.

There is a robust English-speaking psychotherapy company called [Start:](https://start-psychotherapie.de/en/online-Praxis), which has an office in Weisbaden.  They have online services, but their initial appointments are done in-person, which is fine.  Wiesbaden is a bit out of our way, but as long as we can stack Luyou's visit with mine, it shouldn't be that big a deal.
### Action Items
- Check Allianz coverage for psychotherapy, esp online
- Evaluate profiles of Start: therapists for English fluency, compatibility, and specialization for our needs (ADHD for me, long-term depression and childhood abuse for Luyou)
- Make appointments
