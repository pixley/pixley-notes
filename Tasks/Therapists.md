Psychotherapy is covered by public insurance, but we have to do the dance of finding a clinic that plays ball.  I checked whether the work-provided Allianz coverage can help, and it does not.
### Action Items
- Find more viable therapists
- Reach out
- Make appointments
### Requirements
- English fluency
- ADHD specialization for Tyler
- Depression and trauma specialization for Luyou
### Caveats
- Couple's therapy is not considered "curative", so it would be unlikely to get coverage.
## Searching
Largely been making use of TK's Find-a-Doctor tool
- Very few options near home, mostly in Bad Vilbel, and their web presence is shockingly bad.
- Briefly looked in the Bahnhofsviertel area by accident, not much there
- Found one viable option in the area around Hauptwache
- Might be worth looking along U4 and U7 (Bornheim, Nordend-Ost)
- Looked for online therapy providers (I forget the site because I used it prior to making this page), and a lot of them require in-person initial consultation, which restricts us to the RMV area.
	- And most online providers are in Berlin, which makes sense.
# Clinics to consider
## Start:
There is a robust English-speaking psychotherapy company called [Start:](https://start-psychotherapie.de/en/online-Praxis), which has an office in Weisbaden.  They have online services, but their initial appointments are done in-person, which is fine.  Wiesbaden is a bit out of our way, but as long as we can stack Luyou's visit with mine, it shouldn't be that big a deal.
### Costs
- Individual psychotherapy: 118.03 EUR/1 hr session
- Couples therapy: 150 EUR/1 hr session
- Not associated with the public insurers
### Status
On hold pending exhausting options via public insurance.
## Meisengasse
Located near the office, the [Meisengasse](https://www.psychotherapie-frankfurt.de/) clinic has multiple English-speaking team members.  They offer both individual psychotherapy and couple's therapy.
### Costs
Their site claims that they're fully authorized and covered by the public insurers.
