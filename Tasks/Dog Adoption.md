# Administration
## Registration
Owners in Frankfurt must [register their dog with the city](https://frankfurt.de/service-und-rathaus/verwaltung/aemter-und-institutionen/kassen--und-steueramt/hundeanmeldung) within two weeks.  This can be done in-person or in writing.  A registered dog receives a Dog Tax Stamp, which must be visibly attached to the dog (on the collar).  These last for five years, and it *seems* like renewal is automatic.
- In-Person: at the tax office
- In writing: online

Dog owners must pay a [yearly tax](https://frankfurt.de/service-und-rathaus/verwaltung/aemter-und-institutionen/kassen--und-steueramt/steuern/hundesteuer) of 102 EUR (service dogs exempted).  This is paid to the Frankfurt Cash and Tax Office (IBAN DE06 5005 0201 0200 0771 80).

Dogs must be de-registered upon death, transfer of ownership, or relocation with owner.
## EU Pet Passport
The EU Pet Passport is required if bringing a dog to other EU countries.  It contains identifying info about the pet, which matches with its microchip.

Pet passports are issued by veterinarians.
