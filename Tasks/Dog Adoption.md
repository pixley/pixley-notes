# Administration
## Registration
Owners in Frankfurt must [register their dog with the city](https://frankfurt.de/service-und-rathaus/verwaltung/aemter-und-institutionen/kassen--und-steueramt/hundeanmeldung) within two weeks.  This can be done in-person or in writing.  A registered dog receives a Dog Tax Stamp, which must be visibly attached to the dog (on the collar).  These last for five years, and it *seems* like renewal is automatic.
- In-Person: at the tax office
- In writing: online

Dog owners must pay a [yearly tax](https://frankfurt.de/service-und-rathaus/verwaltung/aemter-und-institutionen/kassen--und-steueramt/steuern/hundesteuer) of 102 EUR (service dogs exempted).  This is paid to the Frankfurt Cash and Tax Office (IBAN DE06 5005 0201 0200 0771 80).

Dogs must be de-registered upon death, transfer of ownership, or relocation with owner.
## EU Pet Passport
The EU Pet Passport is required if bringing a dog to other EU countries.  It contains identifying info about the pet, which matches with its microchip.

Pet passports are issued by veterinarians.
## Landlord Permission
We have gotten clearance from Ralf and Mahtab to have a dog, with the following conditions:
- The dog's shoulder height is no more than 60 cm
- The dog is enrolled at an obedience school
- Mattias and Hannah have no issue with the dog
We have signed proof of permission printed out, on my desktop, and on Google Drive.

# Search
## Local Agencies
Due to the stringency of The List and kill-shelters being illegal in Germany, many shelters are clogged up with unadoptable dogs.  This is especially an issue within the Frankfurt Rhein-Main metro area.

## Tierheim Helden
https://tierheimhelden.de

This is the closest equivalent to Petfinder that Germany seems to have.  However, it seems to lack moderation, as filtering isn't especially helpful.
- Dogs labelled as both "loners" and "group animals"
- Dogs recommended to homes with existing dogs labelled as "beginner-friendly"
